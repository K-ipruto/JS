// variables--containers used to store data our program

// in js we create/initialize variables using let, var, or const keywords
// var is an old way of creating variables that introduced too many bugs/problems in code, 
// therefore, let and const were introduced.

// const is used to create variables that store data tat does not change in the application as it runs
// let is used to create variables whose values change overtime

let username = "caleb"
username = "albert"
username = "calvin"
console.log(username)
const adminAcc = "admin@domain.com"
// adminAcc = "new@admin.com"
